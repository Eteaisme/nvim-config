# Abstract
My university work requires me to SSH into a school server to complete labs and assignments.  
Because of that, I started using Vim as my daily driver text editor.

Now although I enjoyed the vim workflow I still found myself missing a 
few features I was used to, hence this configuration.

## ✔️ To-Do 
- **Notetaking** -->     Figure out some sort of markdown or 
                     LaTeX workflow for writing notes

- **Git**        -->     Figure out some sort of git workflow for adding and removing
                     feats.

- **Dashboard**  -->     See if I'm on team dashboard, I think 
                     If I config it right it could be nice

## 🐛 Issues
~- **Bufferline** -->    Bufferline background somtimes turns black~
